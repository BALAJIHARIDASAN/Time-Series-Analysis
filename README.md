A time series is nothing but a sequence of various data points that occurred in a successive order for a given period of time

**Objectives:**

To understand how time series works, what factors are affecting a certain variable(s) at different points of time.

Time series analysis will provide the consequences and insights of features of the given dataset that changes over time.

Supporting to derive the predicting the future values of the time series variable.

Assumptions: There is one and the only assumption that is “stationary”, which means that the origin of time, does not affect the properties of the process under the statistical factor.
